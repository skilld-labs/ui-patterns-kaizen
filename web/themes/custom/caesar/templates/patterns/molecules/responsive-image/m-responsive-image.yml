# This is yml configuration with all responsive image groups defined.
# All required information by drupal is presented here, so on drupal
# side backender can write a simple script, which can grab this yml
# and by using one command he can generate absolutely all responsive
# image groups at once.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: Since we are using "Mobile first" approach, we have
# only min-width breakpoints. That means - configuration of breakpoints
# of responsive image groups should be defined from the largest breakpoint
# to smallest (from top to bottom).
