# This is yml configuration with all image styles defined.
#
# ~95% of all images on the web-site usually have image effect "scale and crop".
# ~5% are about "scale".
# ~0.000001% other cases have other image effects (or more than 1 image effect
# applied to the image).
#
# We don't want to go very deep in the settings, like provide setting for focal
# points, or "allow upscale" property for "scale" effect, or other. It's all so
# rare cases and for sure it can be manually configured in drupal if needed.
# This is just a basic concept of some yml configuration, which storybook and
# drupal can grab and do something with it.
