# This is yml configuration where all image styles should be defined from the
# entire design system.
#
# ~95% of all images on the web-site usually have image effect "scale and crop".
# ~5% are about "scale". Sometimes these values can be different (like 60/40,
# depending on the web-site of course, but still!).
# ~0.000001% other cases have other image effects (or more than 1 image effect
# per image). Usually it's focal-points image effects or something like this,
# and we can ignore it in storybook, because we are using fake images.
#
# Idea of this file is next:
#   1. Prepare yml file with all image styles described
#   2. Then, backender can write a little script, which can grab all image styles
#      from here and generate configs for drupal automatically.
#      Depending on the site needs of course, but usually on large web-sites we
#      can have hundreds of image styles. So it becomes hard to manually create
#      them in drupal -> this is where this idea can help, just to automate
#      processes and save time.
#   3. It's a specification of all image styles from design system, located in
#      one place.
#
# We don't want to go very deep in the settings, like provide setting for focal
# points, or "allow upscale" property for "scale" effect, or other. It's all so
# rare cases and for sure it can be manually configured in drupal if needed.

# Why do you see 1_x_1 image style here?
# That's a little trick for responsive image groups, which can be hidden
# on some breakpoint for example. And when image is hidden - we can set it
# to use 1_x_1 image style in that case. In that case browser will download just
# few bytes (because of 1px image).
